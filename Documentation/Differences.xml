    <title>Differences between LibTiff-3.9.2 and LibTiff.Net</title>
    <descriptionarticle only="true">
      <p>
        <text>Our priority was to introduce as little changes into LibTiff's API as possible. But, as you can imagine, some changes had to be made because of differences between C and C# languages and underlying class libraries.</text> <br /><br /><text>Also, we were unable to resist the temptation to rename some methods and types.</text> <br /><br /><text>LibTiff prefers unsigned integer types for parameters and return values. LibTiff.Net, by contrast, prefers signed integer types for parameters and return values. You can pass unsigned values or convert return values to unsigned types if you wish, but keep in mind, that it will affect performance (not seriously, though).</text> </p>
